## Bio

Hi! I am a computer scientist who specializes in natural language processing and machine learning.  I have received my masters's degree, and bachelor's degree from the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.boun.edu.tr/). Recently, I completed my PhD studies in the same place under the guidance of [Dr. Arzucan Özgür](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozgur/) and [Dr. Tunga Güngör](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~gungort/). Previously, I worked as a researcher in the [Institute of Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/).

I am currently employed as a post-doctoral research fellow at [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) working on [automatic learning of procedural language from natural language instructions](https://gozdesahin.github.io/projects/tubitak2232) under the supervision of [Dr. Gözde Gül Şahin](https://gozdesahin.github.io/).

## Software and Data

#### BOUN Treebank: 
Extracted from Turkish National Corpus (TNC), BOUN Treebank consists of 9,761 syntactically annotated sentences (121,214 tokens) from five different text types: Biographical texts, national newspapers, instructional texts, popular culture articles, and essays. [treebank](https://tulap.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12913/33), [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-021-09558-0)

#### IMST Treebank:  
IMST Treebank consists of 5,635 syntactically annotated sentences collected from daily news reports and novels. [treebank](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-IMST), [paper](https://aclanthology.org/W19-8013.pdf)

#### PUD Treebank:
This is the most updated version of the UD_Turkish-PUD treebank which was originally a part of the Parallel Universal Dependencies (PUD) treebanks created for the CoNLL 2017 shared task on Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies. It consists of 1,000 sentences that were parallel annotated for 18 languages. [treebank](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-PUD), [paper](https://aclanthology.org/W19-4019.pdf)

#### BOUN-Pars:
BOUN-Pars is a Turkish dependency parser that creates parse trees of Turkish sentences in CoNLL-U format. It employs an LSTM-based model and uses linguistically oriented rules and morphological information of words. [code](https://github.com/sb-b/BOUN-PARS), [demo](https://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/BOUN-PARS/demo.php), [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9869804).

#### Semi-supervised Deep Dependency Parser: 
This dependency parser employs a semi-supervised learning approach "DCST" and utilizes auxiliary tasks for dependency parsing of code-switched (CS) language pairs (and low-resource languages, in general). There are two versions of the parsing model, one is LSTM-based and the other is XLM-R-based. [code](https://github.com/sb-b/ss-cs-depparser), [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-naacl.87/).

#### Sentence Similarity Kernels:
These methods use the dependency grammar representations of sentences to compute sentence similarity for extractive multi-document summarization.
