## Bio

Hi! I am a computer scientist who specializes in natural language processing and machine learning.  I have received my masters's degree, and bachelor's degree from the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.boun.edu.tr/). Recently, I completed my PhD studies in the same place under the guidance of [Dr. Arzucan Özgür](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozgur/) and [Dr. Tunga Güngör](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~gungort/). Previously, I worked as a researcher in the [Institute of Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/).

I am currently employed as a post-doctoral research fellow at [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) working on [automatic learning of procedural language from natural language instructions](https://gozdesahin.github.io/projects/tubitak2232) under the supervision of [Dr. Gözde Gül Şahin](https://gozdesahin.github.io/).
